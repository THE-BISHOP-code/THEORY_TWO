Implement a premium customization system for users subscribed under the Abysswalker tier. This system should be accessible through a web dashboard after Discord OAuth login. The goal is to allow these users to visually and functionally customize their bot instance across up to 2 servers by  once buying the tier default, with options to extend beyond that via additional payment.

Core Features to Implement:
1. Bot Customization via Web Dashboard
After Discord login:

Users can customize the bot’s appearance for their servers:

Set custom avatar

Set custom bot status

Modify bot’s public description (with a few predefined lines that must remain unchanged)

Customizations are server-specific (up to 2 servers by default)

UI should reflect which servers they’ve applied customization to

2. Slash Command Creation
Users can create custom slash commands (like /hello, /promo, etc.)

Each command can:

Send text responses

Send images/media

Interact with specific channels (e.g., post to a particular channel)

total easy maxed gui based website....

3. Keyword Detection & Auto-Replies
Allow creation of keyword-based triggers

When someone sends a message containing certain words, the bot can reply with predefined text or images

Should be able to configure these per server

4. Limits & Access Control
Abysswalker tier includes:

Customization for up to 2 servers

Additional server customizations must be purchased individually

Every custom command created should generate a unique code

This code can be shared with other users to replicate the same command on their bots

5. Hard Reset Functionality
Users can initiate a hard reset:

Resets all settings and commands

Clears stored data and integrations

Asks for a new bot token as if starting from scratch
