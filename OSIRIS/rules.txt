Always ask if any doubt if a problem feels hard to solve even after trying for  a long time then rewind to the stage when it used to work and ask me to fix it manually..
For anything which you find confusing like you dont know what to do ask me .
for anything that feels a little old or inefficent suggest me ..
for anything thats has big downsides or you have a better way to achieve ... tell me..
